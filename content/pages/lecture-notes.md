Note from Prof. Hutchinson: "These are transcriptions of the notes from which I teach the single semester course Introduction to Plasma Physics. Despite the heroic efforts (for which I am very grateful) to translate my hand-written materials into LaTeX, and extensive editing on my part, I don't doubt that there are many typographical errors. Moreover, since they are only notes, don't look for limpid prose, and realize that the detailed explanations are in my mind and orally in class, not all here."
