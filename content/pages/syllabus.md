Academic Expectations for Homeworks
-----------------------------------

1.  You are encouraged to do as much as possible of the problem sets on your own. This is the most effective way to learn, provided that you are not just spending hours and hours stuck.
2.  You are permitted to consult with other students in the course concerning points that you don't understand or when you are stuck. However, it is recommended that you do not develop a collaborative solution to problems. Also it is required that your solutions be written out separately and submitted in your own words.
3.  No collaboration or consultation will be permitted on the exams. One good reason to get into the habit of doing the work yourself!
4.  You may consult books or journal articles to assist if needed. If you do materially use such materials, you should give the reference.
5.  There may, in some cases, be solutions from previous years to problems in the homeworks or ones very like them, available from the reading room or from more senior students. It is not permitted to use or consult these solutions. To do so would invalidate the process of using the homework marks as part of the course grade, and disadvantage those who avoided such use. Please regard this as a point of academic honour, and avoid the practice.
